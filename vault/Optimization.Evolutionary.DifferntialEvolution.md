# Differential Evolution 

[Differential Evoution](https://machinelearningmastery.com/differential-evolution-from-scratch-in-python/?__s=nmxbsvy5iswx4rbxa4zq&utm_source=drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Differential+evolution+from+scratch+in+Python&utm_content=Differential+evolution+from+scratch+in+Python)

> Differential evolution is a heuristic approach for the global optimisation of nonlinear and non- differentiable continuous space functions.

> The differential evolution algorithm belongs to a broader family of evolutionary computing algorithms. Similar to other popular direct search approaches, such as genetic algorithms and evolution strategies, the differential evolution algorithm starts with an initial population of candidate solutions. These candidate solutions are iteratively improved by introducing mutations into the population, and retaining the fittest candidate solutions that yield a lower objective function value.

> The differential evolution algorithm is advantageous over the aforementioned popular approaches because it can handle nonlinear and non-differentiable multi-dimensional objective functions, while requiring very few control parameters to steer the minimisation. These characteristics make the algorithm easier and more practical to use.
